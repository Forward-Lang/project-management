Create a Gantt Chart from Github issues

## Gantt charts

A Gantt chart is a type of horizontal bar chart,
where the X-axis is each task,
while the y-axis is the timeline (could be days, weeks, months, etc.).
The magnitude of each bar is the duration of the task.

A task may have a start- and end-date,
it may also have an indication of its progress,
and its dependencies.

For defining dependencies and in turn progress,
Gantt charts usually rely on a work-breakdown structure (WBS)
